<p>
Web Team was meeting in the art room from 3:30 to 5:00<br>
There is no evidence of violence and all members appear to have left the meeting willingly and on time.<br>
Traces of sedative were found on the art room table.<br>
A search of the room trash bins has uncovered art sketches, various drawing materials, and a pizza box.<br>
It is currently unknown where the members were heading.<br>
Kobe is the only Web Team member who has not disappeared.<br>
